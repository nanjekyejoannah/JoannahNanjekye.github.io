###### About me ######

I am a christian , software engineer , Proud Aviator, Aeronautical engineering student at the East African School of Aviation and self certified cessna captain. Call me captain at your own risk. 

I love free internet( *dah it should be a human right*) and use it to contribute to FOSS and blogging. Iam very predictable , I am either at church , school(work) or sleeping though recently playing alot of pool and exploring swimming.

God, Code and Aircrafts we can talk about these like forever. In that order save the last two keep competiting for priority.
